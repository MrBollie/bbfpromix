# ALSA Mixer Frontend for RME Babyface Pro (FS)

## Important: I will no longer maintain this project, as I'm no longer using Linux for audio projects, and upgraded to a different RME device! 

In order to use this, you need to patch your kernel. The patch has been submitted upstream, but is also available from here: https://github.com/MrBollie/RME-Babyace-Pro-ALSA-Mixer-Patch

A simple make should do on this.

If you want to debug it, use `make DEBUG="true"`

Use with caution!
